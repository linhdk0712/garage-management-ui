# Garage Management UI - Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Garage Management UI architecture, including component relationships, data flow patterns, and interaction sequences. The UI is built using React with TypeScript, following modern React patterns and best practices.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer
- **Pages**: Top-level route components that represent different views
- **Components**: Reusable UI components organized by functionality
- **Layout Components**: Navigation, sidebar, and layout structure

### 2. Business Logic Layer
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate business logic and state management
- **Context Providers**: Global state management for auth and app context
- **Form Management**: Form state and validation logic

### 3. Data Layer
- **API Services**: HTTP client and API endpoint definitions
- **Type Definitions**: TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- **Data Validation**: Runtime type checking and validation

### 4. Utilities & Configuration
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities
- **Config**: Application configuration and constants
- **Assets**: Static resources and styling

## PlantUML Diagrams

### 1. Sequence Diagram (`UI_ARCHITECTURE_SEQUENCE_DIAGRAM.puml`)

This diagram shows the dynamic interactions between different layers during various user workflows:

#### Key Workflows Covered:
- **Authentication Flow**: Login process and token management
- **Customer Dashboard**: Loading and displaying customer data
- **Appointment Management**: CRUD operations for appointments
- **Vehicle Management**: Vehicle registration and management
- **Staff Management**: Manager operations for staff oversight
- **Inventory Management**: Stock tracking and updates
- **Work Orders**: Service order creation and tracking
- **Notifications**: Real-time updates and alerts
- **Error Handling**: Error propagation and user feedback

#### How to Read:
1. **Participants**: Each column represents a different layer or component
2. **Messages**: Arrows show method calls and data flow
3. **Sections**: Different workflows are separated by horizontal lines
4. **Return Values**: Dotted arrows show data returned from operations

### 2. Component Relationship Diagram (`UI_COMPONENT_RELATIONSHIP_DIAGRAM.puml`)

This diagram shows the static structure and dependencies between components:

#### Key Relationships:
- **Inheritance**: Component hierarchy and composition
- **Dependencies**: Which components depend on others
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through the system
- **Layer Separation**: Clear boundaries between presentation, business logic, and data layers

#### Package Organization:
- **Presentation Layer**: Pages and UI components
- **Business Logic Layer**: Hooks and context providers
- **Data Layer**: API services and type definitions
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and configuration

### 3. Data Flow Diagram (`UI_DATA_FLOW_DIAGRAM.puml`)

This diagram illustrates how data moves through the system:

#### Data Flow Patterns:
- **User Input**: How user actions trigger data changes
- **API Communication**: Request/response patterns
- **State Management**: How data flows through React state
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript validation at each layer
- **Error Handling**: Error propagation and recovery

## Key Components and Their Responsibilities

### Pages
- **AuthPage**: Authentication and login functionality
- **CustomerDashboard**: Customer overview and quick actions
- **ManagerDashboard**: Manager overview and analytics
- **AppointmentsPage**: Appointment management interface
- **VehiclesPage**: Vehicle registration and management
- **StaffManagementPage**: Staff oversight and management

### Custom Hooks
- **useAuth**: Authentication state and token management
- **useAppointments**: Appointment CRUD operations
- **useVehicles**: Vehicle management operations
- **useWorkOrders**: Work order creation and tracking
- **useInventory**: Inventory management and stock tracking
- **useNotifications**: Real-time notification handling

### API Services
- **apiClient**: Centralized HTTP client with interceptors
- **auth.ts**: Authentication endpoints
- **appointments.ts**: Appointment management endpoints
- **vehicles.ts**: Vehicle management endpoints
- **workOrders.ts**: Work order endpoints
- **inventory.ts**: Inventory management endpoints

### Type Definitions
- **auth.types.ts**: Authentication-related types
- **appointment.types.ts**: Appointment data structures
- **vehicle.types.ts**: Vehicle data structures
- **workOrder.types.ts**: Work order data structures
- **inventory.types.ts**: Inventory data structures

## Data Flow Patterns

### 1. Read Operations
```
User Action → Component → Hook → API → Backend → Response → Hook → Component → UI Update
```

### 2. Write Operations
```
User Input → Component → Type Validation → API → Backend → Response → Hook → State Update → UI Refresh
```

### 3. Error Handling
```
API Error → Hook → Error State → Component → Error UI → User Feedback
```

### 4. Real-time Updates
```
Backend Event → API → Hook → State Update → Component → UI Refresh
```

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Type Safety
- All API responses are typed with TypeScript interfaces
- Form data validation using type definitions
- Runtime type checking for critical operations

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data layers
- Custom hooks encapsulate business logic
- API services handle data communication

### 3. Error Handling
- Centralized error handling in API client
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation for network issues

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient state management
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### 5. Security
- JWT token management
- Protected routes based on user roles
- Secure API communication

## How to Use These Diagrams

### For Developers
1. **Understanding Architecture**: Use the component relationship diagram to understand the overall structure
2. **Debugging**: Use the sequence diagram to trace data flow during issues
3. **Adding Features**: Follow the established patterns shown in the data flow diagram
4. **Code Reviews**: Reference diagrams to ensure architectural consistency

### For New Team Members
1. **Onboarding**: Start with the component relationship diagram to understand the structure
2. **Workflow Understanding**: Use the sequence diagram to understand user workflows
3. **Data Flow**: Reference the data flow diagram to understand how data moves through the system

### For Documentation
1. **API Documentation**: Use type definitions to understand data structures
2. **Component Documentation**: Reference component relationships for integration
3. **Architecture Decisions**: Use diagrams to explain design decisions

## Generating Diagrams

To generate the PlantUML diagrams:

1. **Online**: Use [PlantUML Online Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)
2. **VS Code**: Install PlantUML extension
3. **CLI**: Use PlantUML command-line tool
4. **CI/CD**: Integrate diagram generation into build pipeline

## Maintenance

### Updating Diagrams
